NAVIGATION
The current version of the application has three (3) navigation pieces.  
- The primary two are on the Home Page, which allow the user to choose whether they would like to review their Income or Expenses.  
- The third and final (current) navigation item can be found within the Action Bar, located on the top of the screen.  The plus (“+”) icon allows a user to input a new Income or Expense item, depending on which page they had navigated from.
- Use your devices “back” button to navigate backwards through pages.

ADD / REMOVE DATA
After navigating to the appropriate page (expense or income), click the Add icon located at the top of the page.  From there, simply fill out an amount for your item and a description that corresponds with it.  Press save to store the data locally or press cancel to ignore your entry and start over.

SAVING DATA
SmartBudget updates all information autonomously and saves it to the local storage of your device.

SPENDING POWER REPORTING
Currently, SmartBudget only tracks a user’s total Spending Power.  Future revisions of our application will allow users to assign dates to their income & expense items, which will in turn allow the user to review Daily, Monthly, and Annual financial forecasting.
